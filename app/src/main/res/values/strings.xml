    <string name="sbudnic">"SBUDNIC is a Sputnik-like 3U CubeSat engineered by a team of undergrad and graduate students from Brown University. The program emerged from Professor Rick Fleeter’s “Design of Space Systems” class when a few students received an opportunity to build and launch a CubeSat aboard one of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets. Since then, the program has expanded to include a diverse team of undergraduate and graduate students coming from a multitude of interdisciplinary backgrounds with the goal of being one of the fastest sketch-to-launch developments of a 3U CubeSat. \n\nThe satellite is built with low-budget, easily accessible parts in mind. It is equipped with an over-the-counter Arduino board for on-board data handling, a Ham radio based Arduino add-on for communication, and a camera for photo capture all while being powered by simple AA batteries. SBUDNIC will be sending telemetry data and photos from orbit during its mission life. The temperature sensors onboard will allow the satellite to record rudimentary temperature data at orbit altitude, and the camera will periodically capture and send photos in orbit. Since one of the goals of SBUDNIC is to make space exploration more accessible, anyone will be able to access the downlink and receive data and status updates through the satellite. \n\nThe program is made possible through the support of the Rhode Island Space Grant, Brown University, and various other generous European professional partners."</string>
    <string name="satlla_2a">"The nanosatellites were built at the research laboratory of Ariel University, Israel, under the direction of Prof. Boaz Ben Moshe and by students from various departments of the university. \n\nThe purpose of the satellites is to promote and make accessible research activities on the "new space" and provide a research platform for other research institutions and universities. Both satellites contain several scientific experiments such as a star tracking system, an aircraft tracking system, preparations for a laser communication stabilization system - Free Space Optical (FSO), photography and image analysis, and various other experiments. The size of the satellite is about 14X5X5 cm and its mass is about 300 grams. \n\nSATLLA-2A and SATLLA-2B will transmit a signal via amateur radio with their position in orbit and data from their sensors (battery status, gyros, temperatures, GPS). Both satellites are capable of relaying short messages via amateur radio."</string>
    <string name="vzlusat_2">"The objectives of the mission are: \n\n– The satellite will provide a beacon and telemetry data for which aateur satellite users and ham radio users will be able to receive.\n– Test the capabilities of reusable flight platform, which consists of radio module, onboard computer, Power Supply Unit, ADCS (Attitude\n Determination and Control System), Antenna deployment system.\n Test the reliability of high performance industrial grade multicore SoC payload computer (Application Processing unit) with linux.\n Test the ability to make OTA-updates to the Application Processing Unit.\n Take and transmit pictures on request to the ground.\n Lower the barrier of creating software to space by increasing the abstraction level.\n VZLU Scientists have completed work on the second VZLU nanosatellite and prepared its transport to Netherlands, from where the satellite, together with other European satellites will be transferred to the USA and installed in the dispenser of the Falcon 9 rocket launcher. \n\nNanosatellite is equipped with the experimental camera and with the unit for precise attitude control. In addition, on board there is also second generation of devices which have already proven their qualities on the previous VZLUSAT-1 satellite. \n\n"VZLUSAT-2 is a technological mission that should verify several subsystems for more advanced future missions. Many technologies are being tested in the Czech Republic for the first time. Despite advanced simulation and testing possibilities, it is not possible to fully verify everything here on Earth, so we need to obtain data from the orbit, this applies for example to the precise attitude control system that cannot be fully verified here on Earth.“ Notes the head of VZLÚ satellite systems Juraj Dudáš. \n\nNanosatellite VZLUSAT-2 benefits from proven construction of CubeSat 3U, with dimensions of 100x100x350mm. The flight window for the Falcon 9 launcher is opened from the first December and ends at the end of March next year (launch is preliminarily scheduled for 12/18/2020). Target orbit of the satellite is at altitudes between 500-600 km above the Earth. Communication with the satellite will be performed through the ground station of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia. Registration of the satellite was made by Ministry of Transport of Czech Republic. VZLUSAT-2 will therefore fly with the Czech flag. \n\nNew VZLU space team specialists were also involved in the development of the satellite, which allowed them to gain valuable experience with the construction of the satellite. Gained knowledge will be utilized in future project of the Czech satellite constellation, which is being prepared in VZLU for the following years. \n\nThe co-researchers of the VZLUSAT-2 project are Evolving systems consulting, ltd. and CTU and UWB universities. The project partners are Eltvor Instruments ltd., Advacam ltd., Rigaku Innovative Technologies Europe ltd., TTS ltd. NEEDRONIX ltd., Spacemanic CZ ltd., and Konkoly Observatory. \n\nThe project was made possible with the support of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, focused on the long-term conceptual development of a research organization. The project was implemented with financial support from the state through the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic by the EPSILON program. Specifically, the project TH04010294 named Technological Demonstrator - Radial Orbital Monitor with Spacepix Sensor."</string>

In addition, this satellite has a system that will repeat the incoming data that will serve amateurs. The DIGIPEATING MODE on the satellite will allow forwarding of received messages back to earth to support communication and messaging between radio amateurs (Digital QSOs). The telemetry information will be shared to all radio amateurs and networks before launch. Analysis of the ADCS system operating status and the efficiency of the power system with data from the IMU sensor. We anticipate that amateurs can work on receiving telemetry data and sending telecoms over this satellite and analyzing doppler effects in this regard. There is only one command to be uplinked to turn off the satellite if needed. In addition, this satellite has a system that will repeat the incoming data that will serve amateurs.

In order to understand the issue of Doppler frequency shift and path lose, so that the ground signal can be measured on the uplink, stored and forward issue IRIS-A also provide FM voice transponder, allowing the operator to have both digital and voice operation modes. The students can learn to understand about each sub-system of satellite. The issues of Doppler frequency shift have always plagued the applications and creativity of amateur radio operator. Here, The LoRa payload receivers receive signals, through the Store and Forward, all Ham radio operators can have more creativity and application. According to the LoRa standard parameter settings we provide, Ham radio operator upload the data to IRIS then able to get uplink data from IRIS-A website through the store and forward function. In addition. The IRIS-A also provide FM voice transponder, allowing the operator to have both digital and voice operation modes. "</string>
